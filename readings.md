## Week 1: The Beginning of the End

### Electronic Literature: What is it?

These long as hell pieces could use a tl;dr, especially considering the amount of pointless metaphors and tangents they go through.
One of if not the first instance of electronic literature was 'hypertext fiction' which was distributed on disks. Hypertext fictions would go on to evolve to include  sound, spoken text, animated text, graphics and other functionalities.
I wonder what a Venn Diagram of 'video games' and 'digital writing' would look like.
Examples of Electronic Literature are: Hypertext fiction, network fiction, interactive fiction, locative narratives, installation pieces, "codework," generative art, and the Flash poem.

## Week 2: The Ray of Hope

### Algorithms and Constraint

Damn Shade is hella deep; reading about it in the reading makes me feel like a non-gamer that couldn't mechanically beat the game so they just decided to google the story. 
IF = Interactive fiction, and text based IFs are apparently quite popular with blind gamers (kinda cool).
The word 'bomb' blinking creates tension and therefore adds a layer that only digital literature can accomplish.
Depression Quest removing the objective best choices because the main character isn't confident or motivated enough to pursue them is pretty based.
