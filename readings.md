## Week 1: The Beginning of the End

### Electronic Literature: What is it?

These long as hell pieces could use a tl;dr, especially considering the amount of pointless metaphors and tangents they go through.
One of if not the first instance of electronic literature was 'hypertext fiction' which was distributed on disks. Hypertext fictions would go on to evolve to include  sound, spoken text, animated text, graphics and other functionalities.
I wonder what a Venn Diagram of 'video games' and 'digital writing' would look like.
Examples of Electronic Literature are: Hypertext fiction, network fiction, interactive fiction, locative narratives, installation pieces, "codework," generative art, and the Flash poem.

## Week 2: The Ray of Hope

### Algorithms and Constraint

Damn Shade is hella deep; reading about it in the reading makes me feel like a non-gamer that couldn't mechanically beat the game so they just decided to google the story. 
IF = Interactive fiction, and text based IFs are apparently quite popular with blind gamers (kinda cool).
The word 'bomb' blinking creates tension and therefore adds a layer that only digital literature can accomplish.
Depression Quest removing the objective best choices because the main character isn't confident or motivated enough to pursue them is pretty based.

## Week 3: The Desolation

### Public Holiday

See you all for hell next week.

## Week 4: The First Fight

### Presentations

I thought I had five minutes rip.

## Week 5: The Last Man Standing

### Hypertexts

Twine is sort of kind of a hypertext system... apparently? You use hypertexts to interact with Twine pieces, but Twine pieces are more seen as 'games' than 'literature' I think. It seems Twine is the most recent iteration or medium of hypertext fiction.
Patterns of Hypertext could be described as TV Tropes but for hypertext fiction. An interesting 'pattern' is the Tangle. The Tangle is a pattern acutely for hypertext fiction and entails presenting the reader with "a variety of links without providing sufficient clues to guide the reader's choice".

## Week 6: The End of the Beginning

### Riddles?

Riddle = Interactive Fiction? "What lives in a river?" is a pretty weak-sauce poem imo. Neck-riddles are riddles that require special knowledge to be guessed and therefore cannot be confidently answered by just anyone (an example being Bilbo's riddle in The Hobbit). The line between riddles, jokes, and questions can be pretty blurry. Situational puzzles are similar to interactive fiction as said puzzles lay out and describe all necessary information (allowing follow up questions) and asks the listener to give the full context of the situation. Riddles and interactive fictions should both be challenging and fair; both should provide sufficient clues to reach the correct answer without hitting a bad end (but not be spelled out to the reader/listener). “Every proper riddle must fulfill two conditions: the first is its social function as a competition between the riddler and riddlees; the second is its literary form, which must be difficult and enigmatic, yet containing the clues necessary to decipher it”.

## Week 7: The Struggle Within

### Video Games

"Ultimately, art game design is motivated by two major factors. First, experimental game designers seek to express their specific identities and artistic agendas in unique, idiosyncratic ways, which they would not be able to do in a larger, commercialist production environment. And second, art game designers aim to broaden the horizons of game culture and to help develop videogames into an established art form." Classic Indie vs AAA; it's more accurate to say that indie designers create unique games because they can't make something as technically and visually strong as the AAA backed designers.
"Metagames, that is, games that are about games and gaming, are among the most salient and poignant forms of art games. They use metaludic design strategies, such as borrowing or emulating interface items from other games; intertextuality; and intermediality, often in a tongue-in-cheek manner." I thinkwhat I'm planning to make for my project may have some metagame properties...
"Video games are a language, a grammar or linguistics for various texts. The sounds, the movement, the graphics, the rules (or lack of rules), everything about a video game is a component of some kind of language." Video games are literature.
