## Week 1: The Beginning of the End

### Electronic Literature: What is it?

These long as hell pieces could use a tl;dr, especially considering the amount of pointless metaphors and tangents they go through.
One of if not the first instance of electronic literature was 'hypertext fiction' which was distributed on disks. Hypertext fictions would go on to evolve to include  sound, spoken text, animated text, graphics and other functionalities.

Examples of Electronic Literature are: Hypertext fiction, network fiction, interactive fiction, locative narratives, installation pieces, "codework," generative art, and the Flash poem.
