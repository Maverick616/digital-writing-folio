# Exercises

## Week 1

- [x] Add a repository for the folio
- [x] What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
- [x] What tools or techniques do you use to write?
- [x] Why do you use these tools or techniques?
- [x] How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you facilitate your writing)?

### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
I do fiction, screenwriting and rarely poetry.

### What tools or techniques do you use to write?
Tools: Pen and Paper, Microsoft Word, FadeIn, Notes, the Internet. Techniques: literary techniques, fiction writing techniques, brainstorming, dot points.

### Why do you use these tools or techniques?
Because they're useful and necessary to make what I write what I want it to be. Differing tools have different advantages and disadvantages.

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you facilitate your writing)?
Using Pen and Paper makes my words immovable and only removable by squiggles meaning I have little control over how nice my writing looks and my ability to make large changes is diminished. However brainstorming is more useful on paper because I can write quicker and with more freedom organising the text on the page. Using software like Word on the other hand is slower but makes editing easy so I can shape what I write with great freedom and have no worries about how nicely looking and formed the piece is or will be.

## Week 2

### Glitch Remixes
- The [Dadaist Poem](https://chill-motley-skate.glitch.me/) and its [Repository](https://github.com/Maverick616/to-make-a-dadaist-poem).
- The [N+7 Poem](https://fixed-dolomite-pyroraptor.glitch.me/) and its [Repository](https://github.com/Maverick616/n-plus-7).

### Taroko Gorge Remix
I got "Along the Briny Beach".
The vertical scrolling text is pretty the same, the same kind of format too. It differs mainly in introducing horizontally scrolling text, different words, and also in different colours.
It is I would say approximately as successful as the original, the additional horizontally scrolling text doesn't really add anything however.

## Week 4

### Glitch Remix
- The [Kinetic Poem](https://imaginary-ossified-alamosaurus.glitch.me/) and its [Repository](https://github.com/Maverick616/kinetic-poem-remix).

## Week 5

### How is hypertext fiction different from fiction?
There's an additional layer of interactivity in hypertext fiction, it's also typically more layered in general.

### How is hypertext fiction different from games?
Games are something that have a win/lose mindset, hypertext fiction may have multiple endings but it is more just seen as a narrative.

### How do you plan fiction?
With a brainstorm, which can include characters, themes, plot points, start, end, location, time, genre, and the central idea of the piece.

### How could you plan hypertext fiction?
Same as fiction, with the addition of branching paths, multiple endings, and possibly the inclusion of patterns of hypertext.
