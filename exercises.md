### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
I do fiction, screenwriting and rarely poetry.

### What tools or techniques do you use to write?
Tools: Pen and Paper, Microsoft Word, FadeIn, the Internet. Techniques: literary techniques, fiction writing techniques.

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you facilitate your writing)?
Using Pen and Paper makes my words immovable and only removable by squiggles meaning I have little control over how nice my writing looks and my ability to make large changes is diminished. Using software like Word on the other hand makes editing easy so I can shape what I write with great freedom and have no worries about how nicely looking and formed the piece is or will be.
