# Artist Statement

I primarily write action and comedy because they are what I enjoy watching, reading, and writing. I mainly write fiction in prose, with some poetry, screenwriting, and digital writing on the side. I like writing about themes and ideas Iâ€™m passionate about or think would be interesting to see realised.
