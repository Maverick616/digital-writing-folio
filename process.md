### Entry 1: Proposal
Going into the proposal, my project plan is a parody dating sim visual novel made in Twine. It'll have 3-6 main routes with a respective 'girl' in each route. Each route will be centred around a genre, including comedy, romance, action, thriller, mystery, and horror. Making it in twine does have its limitations, but I'm confident in the software and don't know if I can reach an equal confidence level with a different software. Twine is good with images and dialogue, but really lacking in the music department (as far as Harlowe goes), specifically having a track play uninterupted accross multiple textboxes. If I don't find an adequate workaround it'll likely detract from the piece so I'll figure something out.

### Entry 2: Renpy
Okay so I started playing around with Renpy... woah. Once I got used to it I not only easily fixed the music problem, but I can do so much more than I could with Twine! I can move the sprites around with animations, I can have scene transitions, and it overall looks infinitely better. Damn I shoulda used Renpy from the start lol. The only problem is the IF game within a game idea I had for the Thriller route. You can embed/make games in the game/code, but that looks fairly complicated. I may not have the time to spare to figure it out, and if not I may just utilise Renpy's multiple choice and flags to emulate something similar to inform7.
