### Entry 1: Proposal
Going into the proposal, my project plan is a parody dating sim visual novel made in Twine. It'll have 3-6 main routes with a respective 'girl' in each route. Each route will be centred around a genre, including comedy, romance, action, thriller, mystery, and horror. Making it in twine does have its limitations, but I'm confident in the software and don't know if I can reach an equal confidence level with a different software. Twine is good with images and dialogue, but really lacking in the music department (as far as Harlowe goes), specifically having a track play uninterupted accross multiple textboxes. If I don't find an adequate workaround it'll likely detract from the piece so I'll figure something out.

### Entry 2: Renpy
Okay so I started playing around with Renpy... woah. Once I got used to it I not only easily fixed the music problem, but I can do so much more than I could with Twine! I can move the sprites around with animations, I can have scene transitions, and it overall looks infinitely better. Damn I shoulda used Renpy from the start lol. The only problem is the IF game within a game idea I had for the Thriller route. You can embed/make games in the game/code, but that looks fairly complicated. I may not have the time to spare to figure it out, and if not I may just utilise Renpy's multiple choice and flags to emulate something similar to inform7.

### Entry 3: Submission
It's done, and it always will be. I was very pressed for time at the end and did go for the Inform7 look-a-like strategy. There were a few extra things I'd like to add, as well as more than three routes, but all in all it ended up pretty damn good. Some things proved difficult to implement and were replaced or ignored but I still believe the end product is quite acceptable. Now I guess it's time to look to the future and continue to build on Doki Doki SSS Kyun for my, and potentially others, entertainment. Mic drop.
